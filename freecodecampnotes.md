###Notes
- Seperate css in different files than the html. in the html, link the css 
- add digit maximum in input boxes
- Google has free open source fonts
- Use 2 space indentation , not tab unless tab is specifically equal to 2 spaces. most editors allow configuration of tab space
- For inline elements within text, do not place them on separate lines with deeper indentation. You can place them on separate lines with same indentation though.
- Add open links to new tab on everything. i.e. <a "Content" target="_blank"></a>
- always use external css
