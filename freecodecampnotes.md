###Notes
- Seperate css in different files than the html. in the html, link the css 
- add digit maximum in input boxes
- Google has free open source fonts
- Use 2 space indentation , not tab unless tab is specifically equal to 2 spaces. most editors allow configuration of tab space
- For inline elements within text, do not place them on separate lines with deeper indentation. You can place them on separate lines with same indentation though.
- Add open links to new tab on everything. i.e. <a "Content" target="_blank"></a>
- always use external css
- Default to classes for anything related to visual presentation or layout.
- Reserve ids for:Linking and scrolling (href="#features"), Form control pairing (label[for]), JavaScript or ARIA hooks
- One id per page rule of thumb: if you see the same id more than once in DevTools, rename it to a class.
- Just use CSS, dont bother with SASS/SCSS
- You want to rely on Inheritance. If you need more specificity, implement that directly on the element.
- *,*::before,*::after {  box-sizing: border-box;  ///Very important to add to css file. Will make life easier when dealing with boxes.
- avoid "Imporant" coding. Sometimes you need it, but more times than not causes more trouble.
- Layouts - Grid is easier to start with. recommend using it over flexbox. Then use flexbox after getting comfortable.
- Dont use positioning for layouts.especially as a beginner.
